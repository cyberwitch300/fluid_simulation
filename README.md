# fluid_simulation
This simple Fluid Simulation project is designed to create a real-time, particle-based fluid simulation that runs directly in a web browser. Its main goal is to clearly demonstrate the principles of fluid mechanics through a simulation that users can both observe and interact with.
The project aims to provide an interactive and visually appealing tool for understanding and experiencing fluid dynamics in action, and I hope to gain hands-on experience creating fluid simulations.
